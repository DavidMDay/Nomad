# Matrix Computations

This directory contains the implementation and related utilities for performing various matrix computations. These computations are designed to be efficient and useful for numerical analysis, scientific computing, and other applications requiring matrix operations.

## Features

- **Matrix Operations**: Includes basic matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and scalar operations.
- **Decompositions**: Implements matrix decompositions like LU, QR, and Cholesky.
- **Solvers**: Provides methods for solving systems of linear equations.
- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Contains utilities to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices.
- **Matrix Utilities**: Additional helper functions for matrix manipulation (e.g., transposition, inversion).
