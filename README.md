# Nomad

- **status: cmake build is a work in progress

- **get access as a Nomad team member**: to be determined  

- **Next**: matrix_computations/README.md  

  Currently a weird set up is used to include the matrix computations library  

  without my having to learn more about cmake.  

- **clone**: git clone git@github.com:DavidMDay/Nomad.git  

- **Finally**: InstallStep1.sh
